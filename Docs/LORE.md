## The Great Severance (400 Years Ago)

### The Fall of Aethelgard
Four hundred years ago, **Orodia** was ruled by four great nations. At its heart stood **Aethelgard**, the crown jewel of civilization—a nation where science and the arcane intertwined in ways the other kingdoms could only dream of.

In their hubris, the Aethelgard Magi-Scientists attempted to pierce the fabric of reality itself, seeking to harvest infinite energy from beyond the veil. They succeeded in opening a doorway. They failed to close it.

The result was **The Severance**. Aethelgard didn't merely explode—it was *overwritten*. A dimension of chaotic physics called **The Void** bled through, corrupting everything it touched. The kingdom's millions died in seconds. But the dying wasn't the worst part. The worst part was what came after.

## The Current World

### The Exclusion Zone (Where the Game Takes Place)
A massive, walled-off scar in the center of Orodia. The ruins of Aethelgard lie within, twisted beyond recognition.

**Environmental Hazards:**
- Gravity shifts without warning
- Time dilates in unpredictable pockets
- The air shimmers with violet corruption
- Reality itself is unstable near the Epicenter

**Zone Regions:**
| Region | Danger Level | Description |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Outer Ruins** | ⚠️ Low | Edge of the Zone. Least corruption. Scavengers frequent here. |
| **Inner Ruins** | ⚠️⚠️ Medium | Deeper ruins. Better loot, more danger. Faction patrols. |
| **Deep Zone** | ⚠️⚠️⚠️ High | Near the Epicenter. Extreme corruption. Void Spawn common. |
| **The Epicenter** | 💀 Extreme | Ground zero of The Severance. Reality breaks here. |

### The Triad (The Three Survivor Kingdoms)
The three kingdoms that survived The Severance now surround the Zone. Over 400 years, they've advanced into a high-tech industrial age—clean, rigid, and terrified of what lies within the walls.
